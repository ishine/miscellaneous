# miscellaneous

A C++ implementation of some telecommunication channel simulators for data augmentation. 
Most source files of codecs are borrowed from the 3GPP, and I just add a c++ wrapper.
Currently supported codecs are:
- GSM-EFR
- G729
- AMR-NB

A C++ implementation of multi-channel Generalized Weighted Prediction Error for speech dereverberation is also provided.
